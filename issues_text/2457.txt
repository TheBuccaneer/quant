- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [ ] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

Currently, a CUDA-Q kernel containing the `mx` measurement operation cannot be translated into OpenQASM 2.0 via `cudaq.translate()` 

### Steps to reproduce the bug

Running the following snippet: 

```python
import cudaq
cudaq.set_target("nvidia")

@cudaq.kernel
def bell():
    q = cudaq.qvector(2)
    h(q[0])
    cx(q[0], q[1])
    mx(q)

cudaq.translate(bell, format="openqasm2")
```

results in the following error: 
```
error: 'quake.mx' op unable to translate op to OpenQASM 2.0
RuntimeError: getASM: failed to translate to OpenQASM.
```



### Expected behavior

The measurement operation should converted into a supported OpenQASM 2.0 standard

Not a regression
