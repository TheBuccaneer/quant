### Required prerequisites

- [X] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [X] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [X] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

```
import cudaq 
from cudaq import spin 
import torch 

```

```
n_qubits = 2

kernel, thetas = cudaq.make_kernel(list)

qubits = kernel.qalloc(n_qubits)

kernel.rx(thetas[0], qubits[0])
kernel.ry(thetas[1], qubits[1])

```


We need to supply 2 theta values to observe in order to run the circuit above which we do below via `torch.rand(2)`

```
theta_vals = torch.rand(2)

hamiltonian = spin.z(0)

results = cudaq.observe(kernel, hamiltonian, theta_vals)

exp_vals = results.expectation_z()

```

We can also supply 3 batches of values to automatically broadcast the input

```
theta_vals = torch.rand(3,2)

hamiltonian = spin.z(0)

results = cudaq.observe(kernel, hamiltonian, theta_vals)

exp_vals = [results[i].expectation_z() for i in range(len(results))]

```

All of the above works fine. 

If we now change the Hamiltonian to a list, we get the following: 

```
theta_vals = torch.rand(3,2)

hamiltonian = [spin.z(0), spin.z(1)]

results = cudaq.observe(kernel, hamiltonian, theta_vals)
```

results should contain 3*2 values but instead is a list of length 3 where each element is a float rather than 2 floats. 

```
results[0].expectation_z()

1.7673358748029913
```
