### Required prerequisites

- [x] Consult the [security policy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/security/policy). If reporting a security vulnerability, do not report the bug using this form. Use the process described in the policy to report the issue.
- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [ ] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

It seems the bridge is getting lost when using captured globals. In the following case, `angle`, seems to be identified as a float; the symbols table's entry, however, has its type as `!cc.ptr<f64>`, which is not indeed a `f64`. Thus the issues seems to be that the user of `angle` expects a value (register), while the bridge symbol table gets populated with memory.

```python
import cudaq

angle = 3.14

@cudaq.kernel
def kernel():
    qubit = cudaq.qubit()
    rz(angle, qubit)
    mz(qubit)

ret = cudaq.sample(kernel)
print(ret)
```

```
cudaq.kernel.ast_bridge.CompilerError: bug_me.py:8: error: rotational parameter must be a float, or int.
	 (offending source -> rz(angle, qubit))
```
