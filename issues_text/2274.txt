### Required prerequisites

- [x] Consult the [security policy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/security/policy). If reporting a security vulnerability, do not report the bug using this form. Use the process described in the policy to report the issue.
- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [x] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

Mid-circuit measurements are being reported with incorrect values if a reset follows them. I believe this affects all of the existing simulators.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

The following Python test demonstrates the issue:
```python
import cudaq

@cudaq.kernel
def midCircMeasTest():
    q = cudaq.qvector(5)

    h(q)
    midCircuit = mz(q)
    reset(q)

    h(q)


print(cudaq.sample(midCircMeasTest))
```

This prints
```bash
$ python3 test.py
{ 
  __global__ : { 11111:25 11110:41 01010:36 01101:26 01110:31 01000:30 00110:38 10101:32 00101:21 01011:25 00100:27 01001:31 00000:27 00011:30 01100:41 10011:37 00010:23 00001:32 01111:37 11011:26 00111:37 11100:25 10001:31 10010:37 10100:34 10110:30 10000:27 10111:33 11000:36 11101:29 11001:34 11010:31 }
   midCircuit : { 00000:1000 }
}
```

This *should* print something like this:
```bash
   midCircuit : <similar to __global__ but counts will slightly differ>
```

### Expected behavior

See above.

### Is this a regression? If it is, put the last known working version (or commit) here.

Not a regression

### Environment

- **CUDA Quantum version**: 4e069429bbc7c8715c053ee32b8f7c29ce10276b (latest)
- **Python version**: 3.10
- **C++ compiler**: N/A
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 22.04


### Suggestions

I believe the root cause is that we need to call `flushAnySamplingTasks()` inside all of the simulators' `resetQubit()` implementations.
