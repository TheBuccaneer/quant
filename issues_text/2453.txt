### Required prerequisites

- [x] Consult the [security policy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/security/policy). If reporting a security vulnerability, do not report the bug using this form. Use the process described in the policy to report the issue.
- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [ ] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

Attempting to use comparison operators like `<` throws an error in a cudaq.kernel.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

```
@cudaq.kernel
def test_kernel():
    a = 0.5 < 1.0
```
Will throw:
```
error: 'arith.cmpi' op operand #0 must be signless-integer-like, but got 'f64'
RuntimeError: Failure while executing pass pipeline.

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

RuntimeError: could not compile code for 'test_kernel'.
```

### Expected behavior

Comparison operators should function for floats.

### Is this a regression? If it is, put the last known working version (or commit) here.

Not a regression

### Environment

- **CUDA-Q version**:
