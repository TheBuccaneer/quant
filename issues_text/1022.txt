### Required prerequisites

- [X] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [X] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [ ] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

There is a runtime error when passing a single qubit that's been allocated with `kernel.qalloc()` to `cudaq.from_state`. The bug goes away when allocating a single qubit in a qvec `kernel.qalloc(1)`.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

```
import cudaq
import numpy as np

state = np.array([0,1])

kernel = cudaq.make_kernel()
qubit = kernel.qalloc()
# ok with:
# qubit = kernel.qalloc(1)

cudaq.from_state(kernel, qubit, state)
> RuntimeError: [from_state] cannot infer size of input quantum register, please specify the number of qubits via the from_state() final argument.
```

### Expected behavior

Expect the `from_state` function to accept a single qubit that's not necessarily nested in a qvec. Or, we should pack the qubit in a temporary qvec behind the scenes.
