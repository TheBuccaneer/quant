`FuseWithConstantArray::matchAndRewrite` is returning success even if no canonicalization is applied. I'm not 100% sure, but I think that final return statement should be a `return failure();`. I noticed this when I tried to add more canonicalization patterns for `ExtractValueOp` and they would not run, and my guess was that it was because the first pass, `FuseWithConstantArray` was always returning success.
