We collected and manually classified 196 GPU-relevant bug reports from two quantum software projects. The dataset contains 159 issues from NVIDIA/cuda-quantum (created 2023-03-20 to 2025-09-10, 79.2% closed) and 37 GPU-relevant issues from Qiskit/qiskit-aer (created 2023-02-07 to 2025-10-29, 54.1% closed). For Qiskit Aer, GPU relevance was determined via the gpu_relevant flag and only marked issues were included.
