- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [ ] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

When attempting to broadcast a custom unitary to a qvector, an error is not thrown. In the reproducer below, the kernel produces an incorrect result when sampled.


### Steps to reproduce the bug

```
cudaq.register_operation("custom_i", np.array([1, 0, 0, 1]))
