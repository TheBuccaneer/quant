### Required prerequisites

- [x] Consult the [security policy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/security/policy). If reporting a security vulnerability, do not report the bug using this form. Use the process described in the policy to report the issue.
- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [x] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

Drawing functionality does not plot out mid circuit measurements: 

```
@cudaq.kernel 
def kernel(): 
    
    qubits = cudaq.qvector(3)
    
    h(qubits[0])
    
    m1 = mz(qubits[0])
        
    if m1 == 1: 
        z(qubits[2])
    
```

In this circuit, the `z` gate is only applied if the measurement result is `1`. 

This is how conditional gates are represented in literature:
