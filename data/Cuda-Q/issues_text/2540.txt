We shouldn't be doing this:
```mlir
  %1 = quake.alloca !quake.veq<5>
  %2 = cc.alloca !quake.ref[5]          // this is going to become illegal
  cc.loop while (...) {
    ...
  } do {
  ^bb0(%idx : i64):
    %10 = quake.extract_ref %1[%idx]
    %11 = cc.compute_ptr %2[%idx]
    cc.store %10, %11                  // this is going to become illegal
    cc.continue %idx
  }  ...
```

It is invalid to copy a quantum reference value and save it in a classic data structure (here, an array).
