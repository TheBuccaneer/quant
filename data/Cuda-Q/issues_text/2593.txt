### Required prerequisites

- [x] Consult the [security policy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/security/policy). If reporting a security vulnerability, do not report the bug using this form. Use the process described in the policy to report the issue.
- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [ ] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

I tried to run the demo on https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/applications/python/vqe_advanced.html directly in the interpreter.  It fails with the following:
```python
>>> import cudaq
>>> @cudaq.kernel
... def kernel(qubit_num: int, electron_num: int, thetas: list[float]):
...     qubits = cudaq.qvector(qubit_num)
...
OSError: could not get source code
```

### Steps to reproduce the bug

Type this into the interpreter and press return:
```python
>>> import cudaq
>>> @cudaq.kernel
... def kernel(qubit_num: int, electron_num: int, thetas: list[float]):
...     qubits = cudaq.qvector(qubit_num)
...
OSError: could not get source code
```

### Expected behavior

What the documentation describes on the aforementioned page.

### Is this a regression? If it is, put the last known working version (or commit) here.

Not a regression
