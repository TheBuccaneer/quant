### Describe the bug

As a result of #1853 (merged on July 2), examples like vqe_h2.cpp can no longer be run through the full synthesizer and submitted to the current NVQC servers. The problem has nothing to do with VQE, per se, and in fact, the upcoming release of 0.8.0 should side-step this problem for VQE because synthesis will bypass the first argument of VQE kernels. The problem appears to be related to the usage of the `cudaq::slice_vector()` function, and it can be reproduced using a simple `cudaq::observe`. That is - VQE is not required to reproduce this problem.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

In the latest nightly Docker container, run
```bash
$ nvq++ --target nvqc examples/cpp/algorithms/vqe_h2.cpp
$ export NVQC_API_KEY=nvapi-<key>
$ ./a.out
[2024-07-19 20:34:45.081] Submitting jobs to NVQC service with 1 GPU(s). Max execution time: 3600 seconds (excluding queue wait time).

```

**The problem can also be reproduced by simply calling `cudaq::observe(ansatz, H, init_params, n_qubits, n_layers)`** (i.e. no VQE required).

### Expected behavior

Running the same thing with a 0.7.1 client produces valid results.

### Is this a regression? If it is, put the last known working version (or commit) here.

Yes, I believe PR #1853 introduced the problem
