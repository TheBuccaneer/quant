### Required prerequisites

- [x] Consult the [security policy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/security/policy). If reporting a security vulnerability, do not report the bug using this form. Use the process described in the policy to report the issue.
- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [ ] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

When using exp_pauli(pauli string) in a kernel, cudaq.observe(...) and cudaq.sample(...) calls result in the error: 
```
RuntimeError: cudaErrorIllegalAddress
RuntimeError: cudaErrorIllegalAddress
RuntimeError: cudaErrorIllegalAddress
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'ubackend::RuntimeError'
  what():  cudaErrorIllegalAddress
```
if the Python script is started with multiple ranks/GPUs (mpirun -n 4 python ...). Single qubit gates and CX gates work without problems, even if the number of qubits exceeds the memory of one GPU and several GPUs are required. The error also does not occur with only one rank/GPU (mpirun -n 1 python ...).

### Steps to reproduce the bug

Create exp_pauli.py script:
```
import cudaq
from cudaq import spin
from time import perf_counter_ns


cudaq.set_target("nvidia", option="mgpu")
rank = cudaq.mpi.rank()


@cudaq.kernel
def kernel(qubit_count: int):
    qubits = cudaq.qvector(qubit_count)
    exp_pauli(0.1, qubits, "IIIIYXYYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII")

qubit_count=30
op = cudaq.spin.z(0)

t0 = perf_counter_ns()
result = cudaq.observe(kernel, op, qubit_count)
t = (perf_counter_ns() - t0) * 1e-9
if rank == 0:
    print(f"time: {t:.3f} sec")
```

Start the script with several Ranks/GPUs:
`mpirun -n 4 python exp_pauli.py`

### Expected behavior

Output of the time the cudaq.observe(...) call took
