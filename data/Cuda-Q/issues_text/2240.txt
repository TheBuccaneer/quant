### Required prerequisites

- [x] Consult the [security policy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/security/policy). If reporting a security vulnerability, do not report the bug using this form. Use the process described in the policy to report the issue.
- [x] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [x] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [x] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

```
from typing import List
import cudaq

# Define a quantum kernel that applies X gates to supplied indices 
@cudaq.kernel
def padX(qubits: cudaq.qvector, indices: List[int]):
        
    for i in indices:
        x(qubits[i])  

@cudaq.kernel
def main_kernel(num_qubits: int, some_list: List[int]):
    
    q = cudaq.qvector(num_qubits)
    
    x(q)
    
    padX(q, some_list)  #list passed in works 
    
    padX(q, [0, 1]) #list passed in as argument works 
    
    xyz = [0, 1] #list can be defined inside a kernel - no errors here
    padX(q, xyz) #list defined inside kernel then passed in DOES NOT WORK 
    
    
some_list = [0, 1] 
num_qubits = 3

print(cudaq.draw(main_kernel, num_qubits, some_list))
print(cudaq.sample(main_kernel, num_qubits, some_list))
```
```
RuntimeError: could not compile code for 'main_kernel'.
error: 'func.call' op operand type mismatch: expected operand type '!cc.stdvec<i64>', but provided '!cc.ptr<!cc.stdvec<i64>>' for operand number 1
```
