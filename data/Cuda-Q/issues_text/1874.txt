### Describe the bug

Upon validating the libc++ support, I realized that the execution on GPU-accelerated backends on OpenSUSE simply seems to hang. It succeeds at some point, but clearly only after something timed out. 

### Steps to reproduce the bug

The issue is reproduceable following the validation our pipelines do (build docker/releases/installer.Dockerfile, then docker/test/installer/linux.Dockerfile with the arguments defined by .github/workflows/config/validation_config.json), then try running on the nvidia backend. 

### Expected behavior

The execution should start immediately and be as fast as other operating systems. 

### Is this a regression? If it is, put the last known working version (or commit) here.

Not a regression

### Environment

- **CUDA Quantum version**: 0.5.0 - 0.7.1
- **Python version**: N/A
- **C++ compiler**: CUDA-Q built with GCC 11
- **Operating system**: OpenSUSE 15
