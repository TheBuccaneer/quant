### Describe the bug


Kernel cant take a list of tuples as an input. 

```
import cudaq 

@cudaq.kernel
def kernel(a: list[tuple]): 
    q = cudaq.qvector(2)

a =[(1,2)]

cudaq.sample(kernel, a)
```

```
Offending code:
  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py", line 196, in _run_module_as_main
    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,

	 (offending source -> list[tuple])
```
