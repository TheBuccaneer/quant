### Required prerequisites

- [X] Make sure you've read the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum). Your issue may be addressed there.
- [X] Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues) to verify that this hasn't already been reported. +1 or comment there if it has.
- [ ] If possible, make a PR with a failing test to give us a starting point to work on!

### Describe the bug

After printing the circuit using print(circuit), you get a segmentation fault if you attempt to apply any gates on the qubit register. 

### Steps to reproduce the bug

```
import cudaq

circuit = cudaq.make_kernel()
qubitRegister = circuit.qalloc(2)

circuit.x(qubitRegister[0])  
print(circuit)
circuit.x(qubitRegister[0])
```

### Expected behavior

It seems like one should be able to view the circuit and still edit it. It's behaving more like a dump() than a print(). 

### Is this a regression? If it is, put the last known working version (or commit) here.

Not a regression
