### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.15.1 (same issue for 0.14.2)
- **Python version**: 3.11
- **Operating system**: macOS

### What is the current behavior?

The `AerSimulator(method="matrix_product_state")` backend is able to execute circuits with a large number of qubits, but calling `transpile` only works for circuits with <64 qubits. This seems to be due to the backend reporting a `Target` with only 63 qubits (maybe related to #2116?). This was reported by @stefan-woerner and @ElePT.

### Steps to reproduce the problem

```python
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit import qpy, QuantumCircuit, transpile

backend = AerSimulator(method="matrix_product_state")

circuit = QuantumCircuit(64)
circuit.measure_all()

result = backend.run(circuit).result()  # works

tqc = transpile(circuit, backend)  # fails
```

### What is the expected behavior?

`transpile` should work 

### Suggested solutions

I'm not sure if it's viable to report a `Target` of enormous size... If not maybe some variadic properties or a simulation-specific `Target` is the right solution?
