### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.13-0.15 (tested on multiple versions)
- **Python version**: 3.10
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20 and Windows 10 (tested multiple)

### What is the current behavior?

If I use `set_matrix_product_state` to set an initial state in the simulator - it's not loaded properly.


### Steps to reproduce the problem

Say I have the following MPS state:
```
import numpy as np
import qiskit, qiskit_aer

my_mps = ([(np.array([[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j]]), np.array([[0.+0.j, 1.+0.j]])), (np.array([[1.+0.j],
       [0.+0.j]]), np.array([[0.+0.j],
       [1.+0.j]]))], [np.array([0.70710678, 0.70710678])])
```
(it is in a canonical form and follows the paper which is cited in the mps simulator docs)
It's very easy to check that the state here is a 2-qubit Bell state, with a statevector [1, 0, 0, 1] / sqrt(2).

Now if I create a circuit and set it as init:
```
qc = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.set_matrix_product_state(my_mps)
```
and execute it, for example, to see the resulting state:
```
simulator = qiskit_aer.AerSimulator(method="matrix_product_state")

qc.save_statevector(label="sv")
result = simulator.run(qc).result()
data = result1.data(0)
sv_result = data["sv"]
print(sv_result)
```
I'll get
```
> Statevector([0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j,
             0.        +0.j],
            dims=(2, 2))
```
Interesting to note that Aer simulator returns not even a correct statevector, since it's not normalized.

If I try to fetch mps state right after as:
```
qc = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.set_matrix_product_state(my_mps)

qc.save_matrix_product_state(label="my_mps")
result = simulator.run(qc).result()
data = result1.data(0)
mps_result = data["my_mps"]
print(mps_result)
```
I'll get
```
> ([(array([[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j]]), array([[0.+0.j, 1.+0.j]])), (array([[1.+0.j],
       [0.+0.j]]), array([[0.+0.j],
       [0.+0.j]]))], [array([0.70710678, 0.70710678])])
```
Note the missing 1 in the very last matrix

p.s. If I do smth like:
load statevector ([1,0,0,1]/sqrt(2)), and save mps right after and print obtained MPS
it will be equal to `my_mps` except signs. For some reason values would look like `1.-0.j` and `0.-0.j`. However, mathematically everything is the same. If I load this state now - it'll be loaded properly. However I dont see a reason why values written as `0.-0.j` work whenever `0.+0.j` does not.

Note that this example is just a simple Bell state. There are much more complex states where the same issue occurs

### What is the expected behavior?

An expected measured statevector should be [1,0,0,1]/sqrt(2).
The saved mps should be the same as loaded one.

### Suggested solutions

Check what is happening inside the code, with complex values computations and/or phases.
