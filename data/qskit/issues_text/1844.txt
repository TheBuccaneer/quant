### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.12.0
- **Python version**: 3.9
- **Operating system**: Linux

### What is the current behavior?

Setting the `shots` of a `Sampler` to a `float` results in it failing, but not until the job is executed.

```

```

### Steps to reproduce the problem

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_aer.primitives import Sampler

qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
qc.x(0)
qc.measure(0, 0)

sampler = Sampler(run_options={"shots": 1.5})
job = sampler.run(qc)
job.result()
```

### What is the expected behavior?

The code above fails on the final line, but it could fail sooner, when the `Sampler` is created with `shots` set to a float.

This is creating a usability issue for us in the circuit-knitting-toolbox, where users often do some math to determine a suitable shots count.  If they forget to round the value and convert it to an `int`, they currently get the above error when they go to execute the circuit using the toolbox.  We've found that because the error comes then from deep inside the circuit-knitting-toolbox, the user is typically unaware that their own error caused it.

### Suggested solutions

Check the type of `shots` when the sampler is constructed.  Don't wait until `result()` is called on the job.  Provide a clear error message when it is a float.
