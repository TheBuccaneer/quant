### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.17.1
- **Python version**: 3.11.9
- **Operating system**: Linux

### What is the current behavior?
If qiskit-aer is added in a C++ project as a third party library (as a header-only library, avoiding the wrappers), several "not a member" arise when compiling.


### Steps to reproduce the problem
Just add the src directory to the include path and compile an executable in C++ executing a circuit.


### What is the expected behavior?
A correct simulation process.


### Suggested solutions
Adding `#include "simulators/simulators.hpp"` to the src/simulators/circuit_executor.hpp completely solves the issue and enables the use of qiskit-aer as a third party library in a C++ project.
