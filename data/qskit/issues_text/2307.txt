### What is the current behavior?
Clicking the "source" button on API docs leads to 404 page. (Such as [here](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-aer/stubs/qiskit_aer.noise.PauliLindbladError.html))


### Steps to reproduce the problem
Click any "source" button in API docs


### What is the expected behavior?
Should link to the source code for the latest release


### Suggested solutions
It looks like 0.16 was released but no stable branch was created. Maybe just need a stable branch created and pointing to the correct commit
