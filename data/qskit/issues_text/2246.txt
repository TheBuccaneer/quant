### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.15.1
- **Python version**: 3.11
- **Operating system**: Linux

### What is the current behavior?

First of all, I find that #2056 is still a problem even though it is marked as fixed.

Secondly, at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/pull/2059 it was mentioned that I can use `max_memory_mb=-1` to ignore the check of required memory.  However, even when that is passed, the `save_matrix_product_state` instruction will fail to create an MPS if the error would have been triggered.  Here's a full example:


```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit.library import PauliEvolutionGate
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
from qiskit.synthesis import SuzukiTrotter
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

L = 100
hamiltonian = SparsePauliOp.from_sparse_list([], num_qubits=L)
for x in range(L - 1):
    hamiltonian += SparsePauliOp.from_sparse_list(
        [
            ("XX", (x, x + 1), 1),
            ("YY", (x, x + 1), 1),
        ],
        num_qubits=L,
    )
sim = AerSimulator(
    method="matrix_product_state",
    matrix_product_state_max_bond_dimension=10,
    max_memory_mb=-1,
)
qc = QuantumCircuit(L)
qc.append(
    PauliEvolutionGate(hamiltonian, synthesis=SuzukiTrotter(reps=100)), qargs=qc.qubits
)
qc = qc.decompose()
qc.save_matrix_product_state("mps")
sim.run(qc).result().data(0)["mps"]
```

fails with

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/home/garrison/Qiskit/aer-mps-fail.py", line 19, in <module>
    sim.run(qc).result().data(0)["mps"]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'mps'
```

However, if you change it to `L = 10`, it works (at least on my system; these numbers likely need to be tweaked slightly elsewhere).

### Steps to reproduce the problem

Code example above

### What is the expected behavior?

It should save the matrix product state, especially if given `max_memory_mb=-1`.  And ideally the memory check will be fixed so that passing `max_memory_mb=-1` is not necessary, especially when `matrix_product_state_max_bond_dimension` already provides an upper bound on the memory that can be used.

### Suggested solutions

I have not examined the code yet but may soon.
