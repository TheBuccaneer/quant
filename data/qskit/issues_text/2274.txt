### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.15.1
- **Python version**: 3.12.6
- **Operating system**: 24.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.1.0

### What is the current behavior?

The `seed_simulator `parameter in Qiskit’s Aer simulator backend accepts various input types (e.g., integers, floats, strings) with undocumented and inconsistent behaviour. This could lead to unexpected results or user confusion.


### Steps to reproduce the problem

```
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, transpile

qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

qc.u(np.pi, 1, 1, 0)  # U gate with angle np.pi
qc.rx(np.pi**50, 0)    # RX gate with a large angle
qc.ry(np.pi**50, 0)    # RY gate with a large angle
qc.u(np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi, np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi, np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi, 0)
qc.u(np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi, np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi, np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi, 1)
qc.cx(0, 1)

qc.measure_all()

simulator = Aer.get_backend("statevector_simulator")
transpiled_qc = transpile(qc, simulator)

 , 

# Test seed_simulator with various types
seeds = ["42", "-42", "42.3", "-42.3", -42, 42.4, 42, 2**63-1, None, 0, 0.0, -0.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1e3, -1e3, "\t42\n", True, b"42", None, "abc", "4ab", 1 + 2j, -3j, "inf", "nan", "-inf", (x for x in range(42)), "9" * 1000, object(), {"seed": 42}, [42], (42,), {42}]
for seed in seeds:
    try:
        job = simulator.run(transpiled_qc, seed_simulator=seed)
        print(f"Seed {seed} accepted.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Seed {seed} rejected with error: {e}")
```


**Characteristic Observed Results**

- Integer (42, -42): Accepted ✅
- String ("42", "-42"): Accepted (probably, implicitly converted to integer) ✅
- Float (42.4): Accepted (probably, implicitly truncated to integer) ✅
- None: Accepted (likely defaulting to internal seeding) ✅
- True: Accepted - Likely to convert to 1 and 0 (implicit integer conversion) ✅
- "\t42\n": Accepted (likely stripped and converted to 42) ✅
- (42): Accepted ✅
- b"42": Accepted ✅
- [42], {42}, {"seed": 42}, object(): Rejected with TypeError ❌
- Invalid strings ("abc", "4ab", "42.3", "-42.3"): Rejected with TypeError ❌
- "9" * 1000: Rejected (likely attempting to interpret the excessively large value of "9" * 1000 as an integer. The resulting integer exceeds the maximum size supported by the underlying implementation, likely causing the function to reject it outright with a TypeError) ❌


### What is the expected behavior?

- The parameter should only accept integers or None, and strict type checking should enforce this.
- If implicit conversions are intended, this behaviour must be documented.


### Suggested solutions

1. Enforce Type Checking: Ensure only valid input types (e.g., int, None, bool, string representations of integers) are accepted, with clear error messages for invalid inputs.
2. Clarify Documentation: Update documentation to clearly specify acceptable input types for seed_simulator.
3. Prevent Implicit Conversion: Avoid automatic conversions (e.g., from float or string to integer) and provide explicit error messages when needed.
