### Environment

- **Qiskit version**: 1.2.4
- **Python version**: Python 3.12.7
- **Operating system**: Windows 11 23H2


### What is happening?

Wrong representation of the state vector after circuit execution when using `state.draw('latex')` function.

### How can we reproduce the issue?

When I run the following circuit
```
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates import XGate
from qiskit_aer import StatevectorSimulator

num_qubits=4
circuit = QuantumCircuit(num_qubits)
cccx = XGate().control(num_ctrl_qubits=3, label=None, ctrl_state='100')
circuit.x(2)
circuit.compose(cccx, range(num_qubits), inplace=True)
circuit.draw('mpl')
```

I do expect after state vector simulation to get `∣1100⟩`
```
job = StatevectorSimulator().run(circuit)
state = job.result().get_statevector()
state.draw('latex')
```
but instead `∣0100⟩`.

### What should happen?

So the community suggested trying another approach to display a state vector
```
from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
statevector = Statevector(circuit)
statevector.draw("latex") 
```
and it works as expected `∣1100⟩`.

### Any suggestions?

Probably `state.draw('latex')` has an issue with displaying a state vector.
