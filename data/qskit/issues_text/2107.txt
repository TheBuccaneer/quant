### Informations
-**Qiskit version**: 1.0.2
- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.14.0.1
- **Python version**: 3.12.1
- **Operating system**: Windows 11

### What is the current behavior?
When I run the below code:
 ```
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

num_qubits = 64

simulator = AerSimulator(method='stabilizer')

sampler = Sampler(backend=backend)

circ = QuantumCircuit(num_qubits, num_qubits)

# Create EPR state
circ.h(0)
for i in range (0, num_qubits-1):
    circ.cx(i, i+1)
circ.measure_all()

tcirc = transpile(circ, backend=simulator)
result = simulator.run(tcirc, shots=4096).result()
print(f"Counts {result.get_counts()}")
```
I get correct counts if the number of qubits in the circuit is 64 or less. 
```
Counts {'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000': 1995, '1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000': 2005}
```

But if I increase the number of qubits to 65 the simulator returns incorrect result:
```
Counts {'10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000': 1003, '01111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000': 1012, '00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000': 991, '11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000': 994}
```

Notice the '1' in the all zero state for the 65th qubit (the left-most value). This should not be happening. The circuit that I am simulating is for an EPR (or Bell) state and so I should only be seeing two state which are maximally entangled. And this occurs for both 'stabilizer' and 'matrix_product_state' methods.

### Steps to reproduce the problem
Run the above code first for 64 qubits to see the expected correct result. Then run it for >65 qubits and check the counts you will see the incorrect result.


### What is the expected behavior?
The circuit that I am simulating is for an EPR (or Bell) state and so I should only be seeing only two state which are maximally entangled. And I am exceeding the max_qubits limit then I should be getting an error for that but instead the simulator gives incorrect result.
