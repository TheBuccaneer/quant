### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: Latest development version
- **Python version**: Not relevant as qiskit aer was used from C++ when noticing it
- **Operating system**: Windows 11

### What is the current behavior?

I was testing the MPS simulator with some randomly generated circuits... with some I've got crashes.
This one I noticed after fixing https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/2291 

The call chain was: `AerState::apply_measure` -> `AerState::flush_ops` -> `Base::apply_ops` -> `MatrixProductState::State::apply_op` -> `MPS::apply_diagonal_matrix` -> `MPS::apply_matrix` -> `MPS::apply_multi_qubit_gate`.

It crashed on this line: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/582407a3f8ef5070c850fb4c417c53c1db1f5998/src/simulators/matrix_product_state/matrix_product_state_internal.cpp#L798

`is_diagonal` was `true` (as it should be by looking at the call chain), `mat` had 1 row and 8 columns (being a diagonal matrix, only the diagonal is given, so it's actually a vector)... but at that line it's used with `mat(row, col)` which is generating the crash.

### Steps to reproduce the problem

Again, this might be quite tough to reproduce, I was generating some random circuits with more than 100 ops to test some things and maybe one in 100 circuits crashed.

### What is the expected behavior?

No crash.

### Suggested solutions

The problem lines should probably be replaced by something like:
```
      if (row == col)
        new_mat(new_vec[row], new_vec[row]) = is_diagonal ? mat(0, row) : mat(row, row);
      else
        new_mat(new_vec[row], new_vec[col]) = is_diagonal ? 0. : mat(row, col);
```

... or maybe a vector `new_mat` should be constructed if `is_diagonal` is `true`
