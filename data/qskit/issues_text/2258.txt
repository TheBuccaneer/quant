### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: Latest development version
- **Python version**: Irrelevant, as it's called from C++
- **Operating system**: Windows, linux, macos

### What is the current behavior?

Calling `AerState::probability` throws an exception with the message "Save amplitude square must be defined on full width of qubits."
The exception comes from here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/269c26fd0552836db54f27d511e07167f58d7990/src/simulators/stabilizer/stabilizer_state.hpp#L578


### Steps to reproduce the problem

Configure a stabilizer simulator then call 'probability' for an outcome.


### What is the expected behavior?

Return the probability.

### Suggested solutions

Modify `AerState::probability` to add the list of qubits, that is, insert

```
  for (uint_t i = 0; i < num_of_qubits_; ++i)
    op.qubits.push_back(i);
```
somewhere here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/269c26fd0552836db54f27d511e07167f58d7990/src/controllers/state_controller.hpp#L1382
