### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.14.1
- **Python version**: 3.11
- **Operating system**: Mac

### What is the current behavior?
For CPU-bound tasks, one would want to use `ProcessPoolExecutor` over `ThreadPoolExecutor`, however it seems qiskit aer can't work with `ProcessPoolExecutor` anymore.  There is some earlier discussion of this i see [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/2707) in 2019, including @nonhermitian . I would think we would be able to use either. 


### Steps to reproduce the problem
```py
from qiskit import *
from qiskit_aer import * 
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor

qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.cx(0,1)
qc.measure_all()

# Runs ok
executor = ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) 
simulator  = AerSimulator(executor=executor) 
job = simulator.run(qc)
job.result()
```

Fails with 
```py

### What is the expected behavior?

Both `ProcessPoolExecutor` over `ThreadPoolExecutor` should work
