### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**:0.16.0
- **Python version**:3.10.11
- **Operating system**:macOS 14.x (ARM64)

### What is the current behavior?
Importing the AerSimulator module from qiskit.providers.aer results in a ModuleNotFoundError, despite qiskit-aer being successfully installed and listed as a requirement.

Error:

Edit
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.providers.aer'
This issue persists even after trying to reinstall the qiskit-aer package with various options (e.g., --no-binary, source install, and prebuilt wheels). The qiskit.providers directory in the installed package does not include the aer submodule.




### Steps to reproduce the problem
Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10.11:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
Install Qiskit and Qiskit Aer:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
Run the following Python script:

python
Copy
Edit
from qiskit.providers.aer import AerSimulator
Observe the ModuleNotFoundError:

Copy
Edit
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.providers.aer'


### What is the expected behavior?
The AerSimulator should be imported successfully, allowing simulation of quantum circuits using Aer.


### Suggested solutions
Verify Installation Directory:
Check if the qiskit.providers.aer submodule is missing from the installation directory.
Go to:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd /Users/raviraja/PycharmProjects/Q cryptography/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/providers/
ls
If aer is missing, it indicates a failed or incomplete installation.
