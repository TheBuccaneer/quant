### Information

- **Qiskit Aer version**: `qiskit-aer==0.12.2`
- **Python version**: Python 3.9.17
- **Operating system**: macOS

### What is the current behavior?

Some circuit types, regardless of their size return the following error:
```
qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError: 'ERROR: a circuit requires more memory than max_memory_mb. ,  EMPTY'
```

When executed with the the `extended_stabilizer` simulator option. 

This suggests that this error is not actually being thrown because of the size of the circuit, since these circuits can be simulated very easily on for example the `qasm_simulator`. 

### Steps to reproduce the problem
[ex.txt](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/files/12529372/ex.txt) is a circuit with 5 qubits which throws this error. 

```
from qiskit.providers.aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit import qasm3
simulator = AerSimulator(method='extended_stabilizer')

qc = qasm3.load("ex.txt")
simulator.run(qc, shots=10).result().get_counts()
```

Note that issue #1921 also mentions this error; this error occurs for circuits without classical control instructions. This qasm file gives an example circuit (with 36 active qubits) where this happens: [example.txt](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/files/12529423/example.txt)
