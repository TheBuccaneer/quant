**NOTE**: This is a continuation of #1689. I missed the responses to that issue somehow.

### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.12.2

### What is the current behavior?

When trying to build qiskit-aer, I encounter the following error ([build log](https://dev.azure.com/conda-forge/feedstock-builds/_build/results?buildId=774088&view=logs&j=9c5ef928-2cd6-52e5-dbe6-9d173a7d951b&t=20c71c51-4b27-578b-485d-06ade2de1d00&l=1026)):

### Steps to reproduce the problem

In https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1689#issuecomment-1436662424, @hhorii described an attempt to run `conda build`, but the problem was that the commited version of the recipe was used, which had already disabled the osx build since I could not get it to succeed (this is why in the output it says "Skipped: qiskit-aer from /HOME/staged-recipes/recipes/qiskit-aer defines build/skip for this configuration ({'numpy': '1.16', 'cxx_compiler': 'clangxx', 'python': '3.9', 'target_platform': 'osx-64'})."). Now that the qiskit-aer feedstock exists, I opened a [new PR](https://github.com/conda-forge/qiskit-aer-feedstock/pull/15) for testing the macOS build. I suggest retrying with the [branch for that PR](https://github.com/wshanks/qiskit-aer-feedstock/tree/osx). Note that in the recipe I pinned to Python 3.9 to reduce CI usage, so it should be tested with 3.9 or the `=3.9` on the `python` lines in `meta.yaml` should be removed.

I am not familiar with using `pip install conda-build`. It might be able to reproduce the problem. I usually install `conda-build` with `conda`. If I were testing, I would do this process:

1. Install conda/mamba with [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).
2. After activating the base environment, `mamba install conda-build`.
3. Clone https://github.com/wshanks/qiskit-aer-feedstock/tree/osx
4. In qiskit-aer-feedstock repo, run `conda build recipe`.

There is also a `build-locally.py` script in the qiskit-aer-feedstock repo, so you could do `python build-locally.py osx`, but that does more setup.

### What is the expected behavior?

qiskit-aer builds successfully.

### Suggested solutions

Comparing the build environment in the qiskit-aer GitHub Actions CI with the environment from the conda-forge CI (like the one in [the build log](https://dev.azure.com/conda-forge/feedstock-builds/_build/results?buildId=630667&view=logs&jobId=e35d4f76-8ff2-5536-d795-df91e63eb9f7&j=e35d4f76-8ff2-5536-d795-df91e63eb9f7&t=fa7b4b17-b6ff-5c9c-8cfc-15f888c92310)), what stands out to me is that in the qiskit-aer CI cmake reports the compiler as `AppleClang 14.0.0.14000029` while in the conda-forge CI it is reported as `Clang 14.0.6`. My guess is that `_SC_PHYS_PAGES` is included in an Apple specific header that the conda build of clang does not include?

Searching for `_SC_PHYS_PAGES` and `osx` turns up a few things, mostly related to people trying to compile Linux programs on macOS using gcc. Could qiskit-aer do something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30511579/linux-sc-phys-pages-not-working-on-mac-os-x)?
