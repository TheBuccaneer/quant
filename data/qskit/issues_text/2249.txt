### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.15.1
- **Python version**:
- **Operating system**:

### What is the current behavior?
AerEstimatorV2 gives memory error when trying to execute small circuits that have been transpiled against larger backends.  Essentially it is the same issue as #2084 


### Steps to reproduce the problem
Try this circuit and operator transpiled against an Eagle machine

```python

N = 12
qc = QuantumCircuit(N)

qc.x(range(N))
qc.h(range(N))

for kk in range(N // 2, 0, -1):
    qc.ch(kk, kk - 1)
for kk in range(N // 2, N - 1):
    qc.ch(kk, kk + 1)

op = SparsePauliOp('Z'*12)

```

I currently get

QiskitError: 'ERROR:  [Experiment 0] Insufficient memory to run circuit circuit-205 using the statevector simulator. Required memory: 18446744073709551615M, max memory: 127903M ,  ERROR: Insufficient memory to run circuit circuit-205 using the statevector simulator. Required memory: 18446744073709551615M, max memory: 127903M'

But the active number of qubits is only 12

### What is the expected behavior?

The simulation should work if the number of active qubits is small enough to fit in memory
