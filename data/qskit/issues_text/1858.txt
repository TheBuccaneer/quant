### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**:  0.12.1
- **Python version**: 3.9
- **Operating system**: Windows

### What is the current behavior?
When running a simulation of a pulse `Schedule`, the measurements are not done properly. In the example below, the state of qubit 1 is not measured correctly\not measured at all.

### Steps to reproduce the problem
```
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit import transpile, schedule
from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeManila

backend = FakeManila()
circ=QuantumCircuit(2)

circ.sx(0)
circ.sx(1)
circ.measure_all()

circ_transpile = transpile(circ, backend,initial_layout=[0,1])
circ_sched=schedule(circ_transpile, backend)

job = backend.run(circ_transpile, shots=20000)
counts_scaled = job.result().get_counts()
# {'10': 5835, '00': 5916, '11': 3996, '01': 4253} - seems ok
job = backend.run(circ_sched, shots=20000)
counts_scaled = job.result().get_counts()
# {'00': 2887, '01': 17113} - definitely wrong
```

### What is the expected behavior?
The state of qubit 1 should be measured correctly\as well, leaving a balanced distribution across all 4 states.

### Suggested solutions
Everything about this bug report is deprecated\heading for deprecation, from Terra's `Schedule` to Aer's Pulse Simulator (#1809). Just wanted to put it here to make sure there isn't any non-deprecated cause for the bug.
(For what it's worth, we see no problem with Terra's `Schedule` [Terra issue [10324](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10324)])
