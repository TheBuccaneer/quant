### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: dev
- **Python version**: 3.11
- **Operating system**: `ubuntu-latest` in CI

### What is the current behavior?

Since Oct 17, there are 24 failing tests when Qiskit dev is installed. There is a chance this is a Qiskit issue that introduced a regression in the stable API, I didn't check it. If so, please open an issue in Qiskit/qiskit

### Steps to reproduce the problem

Go to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/actions/workflows/unit-tests-latest-qiskit.yml?page=2 and see the errors.

### What is the expected behavior?

Aer should work with Qiskit dev branch, ie. main
