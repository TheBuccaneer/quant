- **Operating system**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.1)

### What is the current behavior?

MPS simulator hangs during processing of a measurement instruction in specific cases reproduced below, and in the case that (a) the bond dimension is limited; and (b) the `mps_apply_measure` method is used for measurement.

The hang is caused by an infinite loop in the C++ `csvd` code because the value of `eps` is zero and none of the exit conditions are satisfied. The value of `eps` is zero because the input matrix is zero. The input matrix is zero because this is the result of the `MPS_Tensor::Decompose` method, executed in the context of `MPS::move_all_qubits_to_sorted_ordering()`.

### Steps to reproduce the problem

Issue is reproduced with the following Python script. 

The problematic behavior is seen in this test case only if the measurement outcome is 1. This is selected stochastically by `AerSimulator` and cannot be seeded as far as I can determine. If the measurement outcome is 0 the program completes.

When the issue arises, the program hangs in the context of processing instruction `measure q[0] -> c[0];`.

```
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

INPUT = """OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[4];
creg c[4];
h q[3];
h q[1];
cx q[1],q[2];
cx q[3],q[0];
measure q[0] -> c[0];
measure q[1] -> c[1];
measure q[2] -> c[2];
measure q[3] -> c[3];"""

# Construct quantum circuit
circuit = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(INPUT)

simulator = AerSimulator(
    method='matrix_product_state',
    matrix_product_state_max_bond_dimension=2  # hangs only if this is 2
)

# Run and get counts, using the matrix_product_state method
def run():
    transpiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, simulator)
    res = simulator.run(transpiled_circuit, shots=1, memory=True)
    return res.result().get_memory()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    res = run()
    print(res)
```

Changing the measurement method to `mps_sample_measure_algorithm="mps_probabilities"` avoids the issue, but has limited scalability.

Changing `matrix_product_state_max_bond_dimension=2` to a value other than 2 avoids the issue, but the intent is to be able to set it.

Changes to this input program such as replacing `h q[3]` with `h q[2]` also avoids the issue.

### What is the expected behavior?

Simulation should complete with correct sampling result.

The rationale for this particular circuit test is to verify that two independent Bell states which would normally be precisely represented using MPS with a bond dimension of 2 if they were local on the MPS linear chain (e.g. qubits 0 and 1, and qubits 2 and 3) are not precisely represented when the Bell states are not local (in this case, qubits 0 and 3, and qubits 1 and 2). The simulation should succeed but we should not expect all four outcomes to be represented with equal probability due to truncation.

### Suggested solutions

The solution appears to lie in correcting the behavior of `MPS::common_apply_2_qubit_gate()` in the context of this measurement operation, but I have not determined how. Any guidance would be appreciated.
