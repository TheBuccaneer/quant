### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.13.3
- **Python version**: 3.11.6
- **Operating system**: Arch Linux

### What is the current behavior?

Circuits that could be simulated with MPS before commit 39487dbf8cfe002dbf50cbadd923609c933a4a30 cannot be simulated anymore because the simulator reports an incorrect amount of required memory.

### Steps to reproduce the problem

In the following circuit:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

n=50
simulator = AerSimulator(method='matrix_product_state', n_qubits=n)

qc = QuantumCircuit(n)
for _ in range(15):
    for i in range(n-1):
        qc.cx(i, i+1)

qc.measure_all()

transpiled_qc = transpile(qc, simulator)
job = simulator.run(transpiled_qc)
print(job.result().get_counts())
```

The simulation fails with error: 
```
ERROR:  [Experiment 0] Insufficient memory to run circuit circuit-158 using the matrix_product_state simulator. Required memory: 1638412M, max memory: 64016M
```

### What is the expected behavior?

The circuit should be able to be simulated. Using commit 5e77fc83dde114aba7e4f27d6d0247d6081bbb58, the simulation runs successfully and outputs the correct result:
```
{'00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000': 1024}
```

### Suggested solutions

I think the issue is that the MPS simulator assumes it will need more memory that it actually needs. There should be a way to run the simulation anyway.
