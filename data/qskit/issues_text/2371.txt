### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.17.1
- **Python version**: 3.9-3.13
- **Operating system**: Windows

### What is the current behavior?
`test_multictrl_gate` is failing due to low fidelity (going as low as 0.7 from what we observed) for the following unlucky combination:
1. Unitary Simulator
2. Using `thrust`.
3. On Windows, compiling with MSVC 19.44.

The failure can be seen [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/actions/runs/17708625534/job/50326444843?pr=2370).


### Steps to reproduce the problem
Unknown. Attempts to reproduce the error locally using the same OS and compiler failed.


### What is the expected behavior?
Fidelity should be around 0.99999, as usual.


### Suggested solutions
A possible explanation of the behavior is a possible bug in the `thrust` version in use (the very old 1.9.5 version). A recent forced update of the CI/CD compiler from visual studio 19 to visual studio 22 have triggered this problem, so it seems to be more likely the result of a library problem.

However, to update to a new `thrust` version we'll need to update to `conan` version 2.x which would probably be a complex process by itself.
