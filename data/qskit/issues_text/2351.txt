### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**: 0.15.1
- **Python version**: 31.12
- **Operating system**: Rocky Linux 8

### What is the current behavior?

With qiskit-aer==0.15.1 and qiskit-aer-gpu==0.15.1 installed, I get the error message:

```
RuntimeError: Simulation device "GPU" is not supported on this system
```
even though I am using a system with an nvidia GPU with CUDA 12.7 and nvidia drivers 565.57.01 installed.

### Steps to reproduce the problem

```
conda create --name <my_env_name> --python==3.12
pip install qiskit-aer==0.15.1
pip install qiskit-aer-gpu==0.15.1
```
then run the script:

```
import numpy as np

# Import Qiskit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

circ = QuantumCircuit(2)
circ.h(0)
circ.cx(0, 1)
circ.measure_all()

# Transpile for simulator
simulator = AerSimulator(method='statevector',device='GPU')
print(simulator.available_devices())
circ = transpile(circ, simulator)

# Run and get counts
result = simulator.run(circ).result()
counts = result.get_counts(circ)
```

### What is the expected behavior?

The program runs without error.

### Suggested solutions

This could be user error on my part, but if so, please let me know what I am doing wrong. Thanks.
