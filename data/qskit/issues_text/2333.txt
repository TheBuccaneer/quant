### Informations

- **Qiskit Aer version**:
- qiskit_aer-0.16.4
- **Python version**:
- 3.11
- **Operating system**:
- linux/debian
### What is the current behavior?
When simulating small circuits with fake_sherbrooke  we encountered the following error

```
could not broadcast input array from shape (0,16) into shape (4096,16)
(9 additional frame(s) were not displayed)
...
  File "qiskit/primitives/primitive_job.py", line 51, in result
    return self._future.result()
  File "concurrent/futures/_base.py", line 456, in result
    return self.__get_result()
  File "concurrent/futures/_base.py", line 401, in __get_result
    raise self._exception
  File "concurrent/futures/thread.py", line 58, in run
    result = self.fn(*self.args, **self.kwargs)
  File "qiskit_aer/primitives/sampler_v2.py", line 150, in _run
    pub_results = self._run_pubs([pubs[i] for i in lst], shots)
  File "qiskit_aer/primitives/sampler_v2.py", line 189, in _run_pubs
    self._postprocess_pub(
  File "qiskit_aer/primitives/sampler_v2.py", line 223, in _postprocess_pub
    arrays[item.creg_name][index] = ary
```

This happens sporadically
### Steps to reproduce the problem
Run the estimator with a small circuit like the below on fake_sherbrooke
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

observables = ["ZZ", "XX"]

### What is the expected behavior?

Circuit should be simulated without errors
